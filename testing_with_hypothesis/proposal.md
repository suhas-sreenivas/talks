# Testing with Hypothesis

## Description

While practicing coding questions for interviews from a book, I wanted to generate test data rather than manually write test cases because I found that I would miss a few scenarios to test each time.

This led me to a python library, hypothesis, and learning about property based testing. In this lightning talk, I will go over how I generated test cases for common interview questions involving strings, linked lists and trees and also how I chose properties to test against.
